# Websockets with Play Framework, Scala.js, Binding.scala

This project is based on:
* [Algomancer's Starter Kit](https://github.com/Algomancer/Full-Stack-Scala-Starter)
* [Lightbend's Websocket example](https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-websocket-example)

See the general setup on the starter kit page.

This is an example application showing how you can integrate a Play project with a Scala.js, Binding.scala 
project - using **Web Sockets**.

It is my personal Starter Kit at the moment.

## Business Case

It's about an automatic process that can be started manually (button). 
But it should run only once at a time.

So only one actor (AdapterActor) will run the process and make sure, 
that the process is only run once at a time.

Each client sees the LogEntries of the last 'Adapter process' (LogReport) - 
or if the process is running - each LogEntry right away.

You can filter the LogEntries for their Level and/ or their message.

# Architecture
- Server: Play with Scala
- Client: Binding.scala with ScalaJS

The web-sockets are created according to the 
[Lightbend's Websocket example](https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-websocket-example).

The project is split into 3 modules that are explained in the following chapters. 

## Shared
The great thing about a **full-stack Scala app** is that 
we only have to define our domain model once for the server and the client.

Next to the model all that is needed is the JSON-un-/-marshalling. 
Thanks to the [Play JSON Derived Codecs](https://github.com/julienrf/play-json-derived-codecs) this involves only a few lines of code.

We define some messages for the communication:

```scala
// trait for all messages
sealed trait AdapterMsg

object AdapterMsg {
  // marshalling and unmarshalling
  // with json.validate[AdapterMsg] or Json.parse(adapterMsg)
  // this line is enough with this library - as AdapterMsg is a sealed trait
  // be aware that if you want for example json.validate[RunAdapter] you also need a OFormat[RunAdapter]
  implicit val jsonFormat: OFormat[AdapterMsg] = derived.oformat[AdapterMsg]()
}

// a client want's to start the Adapter process
case class RunAdapter(userName: String = "Anonymous") extends AdapterMsg

// the server indicates that the Adapter process is already running
// logReport: the LogReport of the active run.
case class AdapterRunning(logReport: LogReport) extends AdapterMsg

// the server indicates that the Adapter process is NOT running
// logReport: the LogReport of the last run - if there is one.
case class AdapterNotRunning(logReport: Option[LogReport]) extends AdapterMsg

// each LogEntry that is created by the AdapterProcess
case class LogEntryMsg(logEntry: LogEntry) extends AdapterMsg

// sent when the Adapter Process is started
case object RunStarted extends AdapterMsg

// sent when the Adapter Process finished
case class RunFinished(logReport: LogReport) extends AdapterMsg

// as with akka-http the web-socket connection will be closed when idle for too long.
case object KeepAliveMsg extends AdapterMsg

```

## Client
The UI is done with 
[Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala)

The client is split in 3 classes:

### AdapterClient
The whole web page is here composed with `Binding.scala data-binding expressions`. 

It is more or less HTML-snippets that contain dynamic content provided by `Binding.scala data sources`.
They are encapsulated in the **UIState**:

* `logData: Vars[LogEntry]` a list of LogEntries that from the active- or last Adapter run.
* `isRunning: Var[Boolean]` is true if the Adapter process is running at the moment.
* `filterText: Var[String]` is the filter text from the input field.
* `filterLevel: Var[LogLevel]` is the Level selected from the drop-down.
* `lastLogLevel: Var[Option[LogLevel]]` the LogLevel of the last Adapter run - used for the title.

If you have troubles understanding it, please check out [Binding.scala-Google-Maps](https://github.com/pme123/Binding.scala-Google-Maps), where I explained all the details.

#### ScalaJS Routes
To use Play routes from within the client, we need again something to do.
My solution is taken from here: [github.com/vmunier/play-scalajs.g8](https://github.com/vmunier/play-scalajs.g8/issues/50)

* build.sbt
```scala
  // Create a map of versioned assets, replacing the empty versioned.js
  DigestKeys.indexPath := Some("javascripts/versioned.js"),
  // Assign the asset index to a global versioned var
  DigestKeys.indexWriter ~= { writer => index => s"var versioned = ${writer(index)};" }
```
* add `javascripts/versioned.js` to the `public` folder (contains only: `var versioned = {};)
* add to the end of the `routes`-file `->         /webjars                      webjars.Routes`
* now you can use them like `<img src={"" + g.jsRoutes.controllers.Assets.versioned("images/favicon.png").url}></img>`
Don't forget `import scala.scalajs.js.Dynamic.{global => g}` 

### UIStore
I like the concepts of Redux. 
However with `Binding.scala` most of the patterns are obsolete.
What I wanted to achieve was to manipulate the UIState in just one place.
My solution (for now) is to have a UIStore trait, that provides for each manipulation-action
a function.
To have a general reducer seems to be an unnecessary overhead and even worse 
the payload is not type safe.

### ClientWebsocket
Encapsulates the communication with the server. The internal communication with the AdapterClient
is done via the `Binding.scala data sources`.

### SemanticUI
To have a decent look I integrated with [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/layout.html).

The solution is based on this [blog](http://sadhen.com/blog/2017/01/02/binding-with-semantic.html).

To do that we need to add the dependency with webjars:
```scala
// server
    , "org.webjars" %% "webjars-play" % "2.6.1"
    , "org.webjars" % "Semantic-UI" % semanticV
    , "org.webjars" % "jquery" % jQueryV
// client
  jsDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.webjars" % "jquery" % jQueryV / "jquery.js" minified "jquery.min.js",
    "org.webjars" % "Semantic-UI" % semanticV / "semantic.js" minified "semantic.min.js" dependsOn "jquery.js"
  ),
  ...
     // jquery support for ScalaJS
     "be.doeraene" %%% "scalajs-jquery" % "0.9.1"

```
Here is the documentation: [webjars.org](http://www.webjars.org/documentation)

Monkey Patching: With Semantic-UI you sometimes you have activate the Javascript.

see [correct-way-to-dynamically-add-semantic-ui-controls](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30531410/correct-way-to-dynamically-add-semantic-ui-controls)

```scala
  @js.native
  trait SemanticJQuery extends JQuery {
    def dropdown(params: js.Any*): SemanticJQuery = js.native
  }

  implicit def jq2semantic(jq: JQuery): SemanticJQuery = jq.asInstanceOf[SemanticJQuery]
```
This is all - that is needed with ScalaJS. 
Thanks to `implicit` Monkey Patching can be done in an elegant way with Scala.

## Server
When you go to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) 
a web-socket is opened to show you the active- or last LogReport of the Adapter Process.

### HomeController
The web-sockets are managed with Akka Actors. The implementation was taken from 
the **[Lightbend's Websocket example](https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-websocket-example)** 
and adjusted to fit my needs.

Only difference, I made the allowed hosts configurable:
```scala
  def originMatches(origin: String): Boolean = {
    import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

    val allowedHosts = config.underlying.getStringList("wsocket.hosts.allowed").asScala
    allowedHosts.exists(origin.endsWith)
  }
```

### UserParentActor
This Actor exists only once and is a factory to create the web-socket for a web-client.
### UserActor
The Actor that manages the web-socket: 

* When create it subscribes itself to the AdapterActor.
* When stopped it un-subscribes itself from the AdapterActor.

### AdapterActor
This Actor handles the business logic.

```scala
    // called if a client runs the Adapter Process (Button)
    case RunAdapter(user) =>
      if (isRunning) // this should not happen as the button is disabled, if running
        log.warning("The adapter is running already!")
      else {
        log.info(s"run Adapter: $sender")
        runAdapter(user) // the dummy logic that runs the process
      }
```
Each AdapterMsg is send to all UserActors:
```scala
  private def sendToSubscriber(adapterMsg: AdapterMsg): Unit =
    userActors.values
      .foreach(_ ! adapterMsg)
```

# Run the application
```shell
$ sbt
> run
```
open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) in a browser.

# This is the end;)
